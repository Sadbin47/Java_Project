Travel Management System

The project is a Travel Management System that may be used for the management of travels by a travel agency. The system includes traveler, employee, booking, and trip management. It is designed using Java with a GUI interface.
Key Features:
1. Traveler Management: providing features of creating, updating, deleting, and viewing details regarding travelers.
2. Staff Management: This helps with the management of employee details-salary and working hours. 
3. Booking Management: Allows creating, updating, and tracking of travel bookings. 
4. Trip Management: Manages the details of a trip-dates, destinations, and costs.
The system follows file-based persistence to store data so that the information can be maintained even between sessions. This project is quite beneficial for travel agencies since it automates most of the administrative jobs in a clear and organized way, hence reducing the possibility of errors and improving efficiency. In this way, the system will enhance the customer experience and the overall effectiveness of the agency's operations by putting all the travel-related data at one place.
